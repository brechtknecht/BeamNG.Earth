"""The road the player drives on, followed ahead: where a fast player will be, from the map's roads instead of a
straight line or a guessed bend.

A car on a road almost always stays on it. follow() snaps the player to the road it is driving along (near it, heading
with it) and walks that road ahead: at each end of a road line it takes the line that continues the same road (its
name, its class, not a ramp off it, the smallest bend), and stops where two lines continue it equally well (a real
fork) or where the known roads end. The terrain prefetch lays its chain of blocks along that line
(earthd.predict_route_chain), as it does along a GPS route.

RoadAhead keeps the road lines of the map cells round the player, read in a thread of its own from the cells on disk
only (the map data ahead, earthd.map_ahead, has them there well before the player): never a download, never on the
event loop. Off the known roads, or off any road, follow() gives None and the prefetch predicts as before.
