"""The way ahead of a driving player, for the work done before the player gets there (2026-10-25).

The road plans of a map cell the player has not been to wait on its downloads (the cell's roads, its buildings for
the road widths, the elevation under every road at PROFILE_ZOOM, its neighbours' roads for the bridges): 17-90 s a
fresh cell in Munich on a 4-core machine, ~1 s of it planning. The terrain blocks wait for those plans, and the
lookahead was fixed at 0-30 s along the straight line: 900 m at 30 m/s, less than one cell (~1.6 km), so a block at
a new cell's edge waited 15-35 s and the game paused at the block's edge ("Waiting for collision to load here").

points() is the path the lookahead uses instead: as far ahead as LEAD_S of driving at the current speed (MIN_M ..
MAX_M), bending with the player's current turn (the turn rate fading over TURN_FADE_S: a bend, not a circle), each
point with the time the player reaches it (most urgent first) and a lateral spread growing with the distance (the
road's own curves, a turn-off). Pure; Track measures the turn rate from the poses.
